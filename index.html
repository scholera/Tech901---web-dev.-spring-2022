                <p>I am a former actor who got into IT to provide a better life for my wonderful daughter! A former Systems Administrator foraging through the forest of IT, currently serving as a Scrum Master. I have grown to love the development field while serving in my current role. I would like to learn how to be a part of the development team myself, to better understand my current job! I also LOVE LEARNING!!</p>
